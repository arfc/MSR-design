	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor (MSR) refuses to go away. The Generation-IV process lists the MSR as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 TWe globally and 1 TWe for the US by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the MSR are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from LWRs, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per MWe h, then 50 years of 10 TWe power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the MSR could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

In this study, a single-liquid-fueled MSR is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the MSR neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

This chapter is devoted to the fuels and coolants of the molten salt reactor (MSR), which belongs to one of the six nuclear reactor concepts considered in the Generation IV initiative. The chapter is divided into ten different sections and starts with an introduction (Section 3.13.1), in which the general characteristics of the MSR are described. This is followed by a report (Section 3.13.2) on the historical developments of this reactor concept, with the main emphasis on the work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Section 3.13.3 briefly explains the current MSR concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or actinide burner concepts in the management of the long-lived actinides. Section 3.13.4 summarizes the physicochemical properties of typical fuels and coolants, based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the fluoride systems. This section is divided into several subsections based on the properties discussed, giving first a brief description of the structure of the fluoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore, the solubility of actinide fluorides in the fuel matrix is given, as well as information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the vapor pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behavior under irradiating conditions. This is briefly discussed in Section 3.13.7. Section 3.13.8 is related to the fission products and their behavior in the fluoride fuel matrix with respect to their solubility, and Section 3.13.9 addresses the corrosion effects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.},

In this study, a neutron kinetic model considering the fuel salt flow is established based on the neutron diffusion theory, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for the fast and thermal neutron fluxes and six-group balance equations for delayed neutron precursors. The temperature feedback on the neutron kinetics is considered by introducing a heat transfer model in the core, in which the group constants which are dependent on the temperature are calculated by the code DRAGON. The mathematical equations are discretized and numerically calculated by developing a code, in which the fully implicit scheme is adopted for the time-dependent terms, and the power law scheme is for the convection–diffusion terms. The neutron kinetics is conducted during three transient conditions including the rods drop transient, the pump coastdown transient and the inlet temperature drop transient. The relative power changes and the distributions of the temperature, neutron fluxes and delayed neutron precursors under these three different transient conditions are obtained in the study.

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics–thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {The one-group diffusion theory of molten salt reactors in a homogeneous reactor model is revisited. First, the integral terms in the equation for the flux, obtained after the elimination of the delayed neutron precursors, are given a physical interpretation. This gives an understanding of the physical meaning of the concept of infinite fuel recirculation velocity, which eliminates one of the two integral terms, introduced in earlier work in order to find analytic solutions. In the light of the physical interpretation, another approximation, representing a different limiting case can be defined, corresponding to long recirculation times, i.e. no recirculation of the delayed neutron precursors to the core. This approximation incurs the neglecting of the other integral term, and it can also be solved analytically. Finally it is shown that the full equation, without neglecting any of the integral terms, has also a compact analytical solution and it is demonstrated how the case of the infinite velocity can be obtained as a limit case of the full solution. The analytical solutions open up the possibility to study a number of questions in analytical form, such as the calculation of the point kinetic response of the reactor, or the effect of the different boundary conditions. As an illustration, the solutions corresponding to the vanishing of the flux at the extrapolated boundary are compared to those obtained from the logarithmic boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

	title = {The molten salt fast reactor as a fast spectrum candidate for thorium implementation},
	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

Their possibilities of usage as a coolant, heat transfer fluid or heat storage substrate, require thermo-hydrodynamic refined calculations. Many researchers are using simulation techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their projects or conceptual designs. The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties. This disagreement suggests that, in several cases, new studies must be started (and even new measurement techniques should be developed) to obtain accurate values.},

A physically meaningful weight can be assumed as the solution of the adjoint model, which is constructed for the situation considered, including delayed neutrons. The quasi-static scheme is then applied to calculations of some transients for a typical configuration of a molten-salt reactor, in a multigroup diffusion model with a one-dimensional slug-flow velocity field.

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) can be used as effective burners of plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs) from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel. In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter (MOSART) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic properties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 ANS/ENS International Winter Meeting (GLOBAL 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, LA, USA 16–20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary NaF–LiF–BeF2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol\% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides (PuF3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The MOSART reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the MOSART core with the code SIMMER-III [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. SIMMER-III: an advanced computer program for LMFBR severe accident analysis. Proceedings of the ANP’ 92, Tokyo, Japan; Kondo, Sa., Tobita, Y., Morita, K., Brear, D.J., Kamiyama, K., Yamano, H., Fujita, S., Maschek, W., Fischer, E.A., Kiefhaber, E., Buckel, G., Hesselschwerdt, E., Flad, M., Costa, P., Pigny, S., 1999. Current status and validation of the SIMMER-III LMFR safety analysis code. Proceedings of the ICONE-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state (EOS) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the SIMMER-III code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits.},

The graphite-moderated channel type MSR – one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts – was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has recently been chosen as the reference circulating-fuel Molten Salt Reactor design in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum. Different from most of the Molten Salt Reactor designs developed and proposed in the past, the MSFR is featured by a fast neutron spectrum. On one hand, this choice leads to a simplified core (no graphite is present) and to improved characteristics in terms of breeding and/or transuranic burning. On the other hand, the removal of graphite leads to a significantly different behavior in terms of both core neutronics and dynamics. In view of the ongoing development of dedicated tools for the MSFR transient simulation, it is useful: 1) to accurately determine the core feedback coefficients, for lumped models and to get an insight into the reactor safety features; and 2) to analyze the degree of approximation related to the use of deterministic multi-group transport and diffusion approaches, in case of multi-dimensional models. The present paper compares the results obtained by means of the deterministic code ERANOS 2.2N with those obtained through the Monte Carlo code PSG2/SERPENT, for different fuel cycle strategies. In particular, the comparison is based on the capability to reproduce nominal reactivity, feedback coefficients, spectra and flux profiles. In the light of these results, the capability of a simple few-group diffusion model to deal with the MSFR neutronics is preliminarily assessed. Such model has been set up by means of the general-purpose finite-element COMSOL Multiphysics software. It is of interest for a subsequent development of multi-physics models able to reproduce the peculiar MSFR transient behavior.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
The fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor (FHR) is a class of fission reactor designs that use liquid fluoride salt coolant, TRISO coated particle fuel, and graphite moderator. Heavy ion fusion (HIF) can likewise make use of liquid fluoride salts, to create thick or thin liquid layers to protect structures in the target chamber from ablation by target X-rays and damage from fusion neutron irradiation. This presentation summarizes ongoing work in support of design development and safety analysis of FHR systems. Development work for fluoride salt systems with application to both FHR and HIF includes thermal-hydraulic modeling and experimentation, salt chemistry control, tritium management, salt corrosion of metallic alloys, and development of major components (e.g., pumps, heat exchangers) and gas-Brayton cycle power conversion systems. In support of FHR development, a thermal-hydraulic experimental test bay for separate effects (SETs) and integral effect tests (IETs) was built at UC Berkeley, and a second IET facility is under design. The experiments investigate heat transfer and fluid dynamics and they make use of oils as simulant fluids at reduced scale, temperature, and power of the prototypical salt-cooled system. With direct application to HIF, vortex tube flow was investigated in scaled experiments with mineral oil. Liquid jets response to impulse loading was likewise studied using water as a simulant fluid. A set of four workshops engaging industry and national laboratory experts were completed in 2012, with the goal of developing a technology pathway to the design and licensing of a commercial FHR. The pathway will include experimental and modeling efforts at universities and national laboratories, requirements for a component test facility for reliability testing of fluoride salt equipment at prototypical conditions, requirements for an FHR test reactor, and development of a pre-conceptual design for a commercial reactor.},
