In this study, a single-liquid-fueled MSR is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the MSR neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor (FHR) is a class of fission reactor designs that use liquid fluoride salt coolant, TRISO coated particle fuel, and graphite moderator. Heavy ion fusion (HIF) can likewise make use of liquid fluoride salts, to create thick or thin liquid layers to protect structures in the target chamber from ablation by target X-rays and damage from fusion neutron irradiation. This presentation summarizes ongoing work in support of design development and safety analysis of FHR systems. Development work for fluoride salt systems with application to both FHR and HIF includes thermal-hydraulic modeling and experimentation, salt chemistry control, tritium management, salt corrosion of metallic alloys, and development of major components (e.g., pumps, heat exchangers) and gas-Brayton cycle power conversion systems. In support of FHR development, a thermal-hydraulic experimental test bay for separate effects (SETs) and integral effect tests (IETs) was built at UC Berkeley, and a second IET facility is under design. The experiments investigate heat transfer and fluid dynamics and they make use of oils as simulant fluids at reduced scale, temperature, and power of the prototypical salt-cooled system. With direct application to HIF, vortex tube flow was investigated in scaled experiments with mineral oil. Liquid jets response to impulse loading was likewise studied using water as a simulant fluid. A set of four workshops engaging industry and national laboratory experts were completed in 2012, with the goal of developing a technology pathway to the design and licensing of a commercial FHR. The pathway will include experimental and modeling efforts at universities and national laboratories, requirements for a component test facility for reliability testing of fluoride salt equipment at prototypical conditions, requirements for an FHR test reactor, and development of a pre-conceptual design for a commercial reactor.},

	abstract = {The one-group diffusion theory of molten salt reactors in a homogeneous reactor model is revisited. First, the integral terms in the equation for the flux, obtained after the elimination of the delayed neutron precursors, are given a physical interpretation. This gives an understanding of the physical meaning of the concept of infinite fuel recirculation velocity, which eliminates one of the two integral terms, introduced in earlier work in order to find analytic solutions. In the light of the physical interpretation, another approximation, representing a different limiting case can be defined, corresponding to long recirculation times, i.e. no recirculation of the delayed neutron precursors to the core. This approximation incurs the neglecting of the other integral term, and it can also be solved analytically. Finally it is shown that the full equation, without neglecting any of the integral terms, has also a compact analytical solution and it is demonstrated how the case of the infinite velocity can be obtained as a limit case of the full solution. The analytical solutions open up the possibility to study a number of questions in analytical form, such as the calculation of the point kinetic response of the reactor, or the effect of the different boundary conditions. As an illustration, the solutions corresponding to the vanishing of the flux at the extrapolated boundary are compared to those obtained from the logarithmic boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor (MSR) refuses to go away. The Generation-IV process lists the MSR as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 TWe globally and 1 TWe for the US by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the MSR are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from LWRs, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per MWe h, then 50 years of 10 TWe power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the MSR could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

Does the reactor go solid as soon as the reaction stops, or does the decay heat keep it liquid for a while. If so, how long before it becomes liquid? That should be a simple analysis, but I don't know anything about thermal hydraulics…- An advantage of solid fuel is that the fission products are contained. A disadvantage, compared to liquid fuel, is that the burnup is limited by material properties of the fuel materials. (What is the burnup limit for the pebble in the FHR?)-  ‘denatured’  MEANS {\textless}20\% enrichment""" Advantageous characteristics of the basic molten-salt reactor include:1) a reactor in which a ‘liquid core’ can burn a variety of fuels: 233 UF4 , 235 UF4  or 239 PuF4. Fuel salt in the form of uranium fluoride or plutonium fluoride is dissolved in the molten salt coolant and undergoes fission in the reactor core.2) Since the fuel is already molten in the primary coolant, there is no possibility of fuel meltdown. The primary coolant, its fuel and fission products can be easily immobilised in the event of a reactor ‘scram’ due to the salt’s high freezing ({\textasciitilde}458°C) temperature and low vapour pressure (evaporation rate). In the event of an emergency shutdown, the coolant can be drained into separate sub-critical holding tanks.3) The fluoride salt is known as FLiBe; standing for Fluoride-Lithium-Beryllium. FLiBe has a melting temperature of {\textasciitilde}458°C and a boiling temperature of {\textasciitilde}1400°C. The primary coolant fuel salt has a molar composition of 70\% 7 LiF, 18\% BeF2  and a 12\% mixture of 235 UF4 , ThF4  and ZrF4 . The secondary coolant salt responsible for driving the turbine generators is composed of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride only and has a 2:1 lithium to beryllium ratio (Li2 BeF4 ).4) FLiBe has a similar volumetric heat capacity and a similar thermal conductivity compared to pressurized water. The higher boiling point and lower vapour pressure of FLiBe means MSRs operate at higher thermal efficiencies, and the ability to operate without pressurisation compared to current water-cooled PWRs.5) Unlike Na-K coolants of Fast Breeder Reactors, FLiBe will not violently react with water or burn in air.6) Since MSRs do not require a pressurised primary-containment or a large secondary containment building for steam capture as needed for PWRs, MSR reactor size and back-up safety systems can be reduced in volume and complexity.7) Costly PWR fuel-bundle fabrication is unnecessary for liquid fueled MSRs, reducing operational costs.8) With a molten core with liquid fuel, krypton and xenon poisons can be out-gassed and removed from the primary coolant during operation, avoiding the ceramic cracking and damage associated with UO2  pellet irradiation.9) A liquid fuel MSR works well when deployed in tandem with a reprocessing facility to maintain minimum fissile inventory in the core. Fuel reprocessing including refueling and waste removal can occur whilst the MSR remains at power (ie. on-the-fly reprocessing). Also, sufficiently low fission inventory in the salt can be maintained so that decay heat could be minimised after reactor shutdown.10) Since the primary cooling loop operates at a high temperature (700°C - 1000°C), it is possible to use Brayton cycle turbines that are compact and have the potential to deliver 45\% thermal-mechanical conversion efficiency.Challenges to be addressed for liquid-fuel molten salts reactors with FLiBe:1) the primary coolant loop will be highly radioactive due to fission products being in solution with the primary coolant salt. This will complicate maintenance procedures which would require the use of flushing salts and remote handling techniques.2) Beryllium is chemically toxic.3) lithium-7 must be +99.99\% pure and its isotopic separation from Lithium-6 is costly. Lithium 6 is unwanted for its transmutation into tritium upon neutron capture. The presence of tritium (an isotope of hydrogen) can degrade the structural integrity of the containment vessel.4) Close attention must be paid to the chemical composition of the salt to maintain a chemically reduced solution for deterring uranium out-precipitation. The out precipitation of uranium would lead to solid uranium depositing on the bottom of the reactor vessel, causing local hot spots that may affect the integrity of the primary containment vessel. One manner of control is to vary the mixture of UF4  to UF3  during operations to maintain a slight excess of fluorine molecules.5) As the fuel is burnt in the core, fission products will be produced. Each fission product and daughter decay products would react differently with the metal alloy containment vessel. More work needs to be done to understand the reaction between alloys and fission products.6) The benefit of having a primary coolant with a high melting point that will ‘freeze easily’ to immobilize waste could result in some operational challenges. Some areas of the reactor that loose heat easily – eg heat exchanger surfaces and long narrow tubing, must be sufficiently well designed so they don’t freeze over during reactor operation.7) FLiBe salts have the ability to maintain a liquid form up to 1400°C, allowing the possibility for very high temperature operations. The metallic alloys containing the liquid thus become the system’s weakest link. To exploit FLiBe’s advantages, new metallic alloys or non-metallics (eg. C-Si) resistant to both high temperatures and radiation need to be developed and qualified.Proponents of the MSR design often talk of using U-233, bred from thorium, as fuel. Characteristics of the thorium fuel cycle include:1) U-233 breeding by Th-232 neutron capture. Fast or thermal neutron capture by Th-232 produces Th-233 (halflife 22min) beta decaying to Pa-233 (half-life 27days) and beta decaying again to U-233 (half-life 1.59 x 105 years) following the Neptunium decay series.2) U-233 can be chemically separated from Pa-233 and Th-232 in contrast to costly U-235/U 238 isotopic separation.3) From a nuclear non-proliferation stand point using thorium / U-233 is preferable. The breeding of U-233 contains trace amounts of a hard-gamma emitter: Tl-208. This makes U-233 difficult to handle and easier to detect.4) The hard-gamma emitting decay products U-233 means they are difficult to handle and fabricate into dioxide pellet fuel. The use of U-233 is more straight-forward in MSRs which only require their dissolution in the primary coolant.5) The thorium fuel cycle produces less long-life radioactive waste compared to the U-235/U238 fuel cycle.6) Thorium reserves are plentiful; its relative abundance is 4 times that of natural uranium and has the potential to supply earth’s energy demands for thousands of years.},

The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

This chapter is devoted to the fuels and coolants of the molten salt reactor (MSR), which belongs to one of the six nuclear reactor concepts considered in the Generation IV initiative. The chapter is divided into ten different sections and starts with an introduction (Section 3.13.1), in which the general characteristics of the MSR are described. This is followed by a report (Section 3.13.2) on the historical developments of this reactor concept, with the main emphasis on the work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Section 3.13.3 briefly explains the current MSR concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or actinide burner concepts in the management of the long-lived actinides. Section 3.13.4 summarizes the physicochemical properties of typical fuels and coolants, based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the fluoride systems. This section is divided into several subsections based on the properties discussed, giving first a brief description of the structure of the fluoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore, the solubility of actinide fluorides in the fuel matrix is given, as well as information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the vapor pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behavior under irradiating conditions. This is briefly discussed in Section 3.13.7. Section 3.13.8 is related to the fission products and their behavior in the fluoride fuel matrix with respect to their solubility, and Section 3.13.9 addresses the corrosion effects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.},

	abstract = {The neutron kinetics of the molten salt reactor is significantly influenced by the fuel salt flow, which leads to the analysis methods for the conventional reactors using solid fuels not being applicable for the molten salt reactors. In this study, a neutron kinetic model considering the fuel salt flow is established based on the neutron diffusion theory, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for the fast and thermal neutron fluxes and six-group balance equations for delayed neutron precursors. The temperature feedback on the neutron kinetics is considered by introducing a heat transfer model in the core, in which the group constants which are dependent on the temperature are calculated by the code DRAGON. The mathematical equations are discretized and numerically calculated by developing a code, in which the fully implicit scheme is adopted for the time-dependent terms, and the power law scheme is for the convection–diffusion terms. The neutron kinetics is conducted during three transient conditions including the rods drop transient, the pump coastdown transient and the inlet temperature drop transient. The relative power changes and the distributions of the temperature, neutron fluxes and delayed neutron precursors under these three different transient conditions are obtained in the study. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of this new generation reactor.},

- Small Advanced High Temperature Reactors (SmAHTR), which are either pebble bed UCBerkeley types or full solid fuel block types
- MSRs, traditional thorium breeders
- DSMRs, 233U converters with a bunch of 238U thrown in for "Denaturing." These are the reactors that the article seeks to promote. They have a strong advantage over MSRs in terms of simplicity as well as proliferation resistance. They have an advantage over the solid block FHR concerning the graphite replacement frequency. Their main advantage over the pebble bed fhr, though, is simply fuel utilization and resulting TRU waste. The DMSR utilizes fuel much better and liquid reprocessing is 'easy' compared to solid triso reprocessing, so you can get rid of most TRU. You have to extract the TRU from used salt and put it into new salt to get this utilization.
There is a great table in this document comparing things. If you add rows to this table, can you make the argument for PB-FHRs?

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics–thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

In a thermal spectrum, it would be possible to reach an acceptable concept only after in depth investigations taking into account the effect of the salt (negative feedback coefficient) and of the graphite (which makes the global feedback coefficient positive) separately. For very thermalized spectra, the global coefficients are negative thanks to the large neutron losses in the moderator but this leads also to a very poor breeding ratio. Epithermal or fast neutron spectra thus seem more favorable since they combine good feedback coefficients with satisfactory breeding ratio. However they lead to severe problems with the graphite’s ability to withstand the irradiation. As a result, the solution that removes the moderating block seems especially attractive."},

	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

	abstract = {The development of spatial dynamics code for molten salt reactors (MSRs) is reported in this paper. The graphite-moderated channel type MSR – one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts – was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) can be used as effective burners of plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs) from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel. In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter (MOSART) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic properties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 ANS/ENS International Winter Meeting (GLOBAL 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, LA, USA 16–20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary NaF–LiF–BeF2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol\% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides (PuF3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The MOSART reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the MOSART core with the code SIMMER-III [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. SIMMER-III: an advanced computer program for LMFBR severe accident analysis. Proceedings of the ANP’ 92, Tokyo, Japan; Kondo, Sa., Tobita, Y., Morita, K., Brear, D.J., Kamiyama, K., Yamano, H., Fujita, S., Maschek, W., Fischer, E.A., Kiefhaber, E., Buckel, G., Hesselschwerdt, E., Flad, M., Costa, P., Pigny, S., 1999. Current status and validation of the SIMMER-III LMFR safety analysis code. Proceedings of the ICONE-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state (EOS) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the SIMMER-III code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits.},

The main objectives of the thermal–hydraulics studies are to design the core cavity walls in order to increase the overall flow mixing and to reduce the temperature peaking factors in the salt and on the core walls. The results of the CFD simulations show that for the chosen core design acceptable temperature distributions can be obtained by using a curved core cavity shape, inlets and outlets. The hot spot temperature is less than 10 °C above the average core outlet temperature and is located in the centre of the top wall of the core. The results show also a moderate level of sensitivity to the working point.},
